I attended a meetup Lost in transaction? Strategies to manage consistency in distributed systems at https://live.eventinsight.io/1217-devnex21/virtualevent/
The event was online, so I didnâ€™t get to mingle with the other attendees, but I did get to interact with one of the speakers, Bernd Ruecker, co-founder and Chief Technologist of Camunda.

After the event, I sent him an e-mail thanking for his time and if he wants to do Q&A session with me for the path of a software developer.
